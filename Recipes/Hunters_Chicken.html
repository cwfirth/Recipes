    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>We love chicken, BBQ sauce and cheese (who doesnt?!), so a perfect meal for us is this slimming friendly Slow Cooked Hunters Chicken.</p>
    <p>If you havent tried cooking chicken in the slow cooker you really should, you wont believe how moist and tender it is!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>5 bacon medallions</li>
        <li>100 g reduced fat cheddar grated</li>
        <li>BBQ Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap each chicken breast in a bacon medallion and secure it underneath with a cocktail stick</li>
        <li>Place the wrapped chicken in the slow cooker</li>
        <li>Pour the BBQ sauce over the chicken, stir gently to make sure it is coated</li>
        <li>Turn on the slow cooker and cook for 3 hours on High/Medium OR 6 hours on Low</li>
        <li>When the chicken is cooked, remove them from the slow cooker and place them in an oven proof dish.</li>
        <li>Check the consistency of the sauce. If it needs thickening slightly turn up the heat on the slow cooker and allow it to simmer, with the lid off for a couple of minutes</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the chicken and sprinkle each one with 20g/Â¼ cup of grated cheese, then place under a pre heated grill until the cheese starts to brown</li>
        <li>Serve with anything you want, salad, rice, baked potatoes and veg</li>
    </ol>
